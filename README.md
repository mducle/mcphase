McPhase is a Mean-field monte-Carlo simulation program for magnetic PHASE diagrams 
and excitations, originally developed by Martin Rotter. For the 
[online documentation](http://www.mcphase.de/manual/index.html),
please see the [McPhase webpage](http://mcphase.de).

McPhase uses the mean-field approximation to calculate magnetic structures and
magnetic-field vs temperature phase diagrams from input files which specify the
crystal structure of a magnetic material and the exchange interactions between
the magnetic ions in this material.

McPhase can also calculate the magnetic excitations (magnons) using the random phase
approximation. The mean field and random phase approximations, as applied to local
moment magnets, are described in detail in [Rare Earth Magnetism](https://www.fys.ku.dk/~jjensen/REM.htm) 
by Jensen and Mackintosh.
